This script autimatically creates backups of a script every 5 minutes. This can be changed by changing time.sleep(300).

Put this script in the same folder as the script you are macking backups of. The script will create a Backups folder, unless there already is one, and will store the backups there.

Future Changes:
-A preferences file so you dont have to enter the file name every time or can change the wait time easily.
-A custom window that opens when you run the program so you can manually create and restore backups, and change preferences easily.

If you have any suggestions, please let me know at william@dolier.net
